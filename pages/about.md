# **About Me**
<!-- Hi there! I am **{{ site.author.name }}**.<br> -->
Hi there! I'm Priyansh.<br>
As a Data Scientist at Hero FinCorp, I'm involved in building predictive models and performing detailed analyses on financial datasets to support business decisions. <br>
Funny thing is, I actually started out studying Manufacturing Engineering at BITS Pilani. But somewhere along the line, I got completely hooked on some AI and neuroscience projects, and that basically set me off on this whole new path. <br>
For my final year bachelor's thesis, I worked on Distributional Reinforcement Learning with [Dr Sara Matias](https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/directory/sara-matias/) and [Dr Jay Hennig](https://mobeets.github.io/me/) from Uchida Lab at Harvard University.
Prior to that, I spent some time with [Dr Saurabh Gandhi](https://csndl-iitd.github.io/cndl-website/) from IIT Delhi (now at IIT Jodhpur), working with EEG data from Alzheimer's patients on pre-trained RNN models, to see which regions are recording (unusual) activity. Later that year, with [Dr Dhiraj](https://sites.google.com/site/dhirajcsirceeri/) at CEERI Pilani, I used OpenCV for finding identifying infected fruits by looking at the X-ray scans of the fruits. <br>

Once in a while, I have fun with the camera; impulsively clicking [pictures](https://avg-bitsian.github.io/shots/) of my surroundings. <br>

You'll often find me making horrible [puns](https://avg-bitsian.github.io/humour/) to _lighten_ the mood.
