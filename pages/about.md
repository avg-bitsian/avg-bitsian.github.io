# **About Me**

Hi there! I am **{{ site.author.name }}**.<br>
I am a final year student at BITS Pilani. Though I am majoring in Manufacturing Engineering, I spend most of my time working on AI and neuroscience projects. I have been an avid follower of Formula 1, air crash investigations, and Shah Rukh Khan (movies). My Spotify wrapped says that I listen to Bollywood, 80s Rock, and R&B (hey, I can't argue with data). Once in a while, I have fun with the camera; impulsively clicking [pictures](https://avg-bitsian.github.io/shots/) of my surroundings. <br>

You'll often find me making horrible [puns](https://avg-bitsian.github.io/humour/) to _lighten_ the mood.
