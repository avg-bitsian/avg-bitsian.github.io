# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**.<br>
I am a pre-final year student at BITS Pilani, majoring in Manufacturing Engineering. <br>
Most of my time is spent on reading and working on computational neuroscience projects. On my off-days, you'll often catch me indulging in my love for Formula 1, air crash investigations, and the culinary genius of Gordon Ramsay. My playlist is never complete without 80s Rock or Jazz music. I have fun with the camera as and when time permits â€” impulsively clicking [pictures](https://avg-bitsian.github.io/shots/) of my surroundings. <br>

I am an extrovert by nature, occasionaly crafting [puns](https://avg-bitsian.github.io/humour/) to lighten the mood.
