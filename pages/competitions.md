1. APOGEE is the annual technical fest of BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus. Our team of six members participated in the Paper Presentation event held during APOGEE. 
2. Our  project was an in-wheel suspension system that allows a wheel change its stiffness according to the terrain. The prototype was printed on a miniature scale to check its feasibility to implement on an actual wheel.
3. Our team **won first position** in the mechanical domain.

<img align ="right" src="/img/e_yantra.png" width="334" height="168">
1. We used Python and ROS to fly multiple drones autonomously, making them pick and place boxes at given setpoints.
2. Designed ArUco marker detection code using computer vision algorithms and formulated a dynamic delivery algorithm for the two drones to pick and drop the boxes to required setpoints.
3. We qualified till the semi finals and our team ranked **24 out of the participating 160 teams**.
