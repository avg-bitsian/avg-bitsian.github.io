1. We used Python and ROS to fly multiple drones autonomously, making them pick and place boxes at given setpoints.
2. Designed ArUco marker detection code using computer vision algorithms and formulated a dynamic delivery algorithm for the two drones to pick and drop the boxes to required setpoints.
3. We qualified till the semi finals and our team ranked **24 out of the participating 160 teams**.
