---

Markup:     * Used Python and ROS to fly multiple drones autonomously, making them pick and place boxes at given setpoints.
            * Designed ArUco marker detection code using computer vision algorithms and formulated a dynamic delivery algorithm for the two drones to pick and drop the boxes to required setpoints.
            * Our team ranked 24 out of the participating 160 teams.
