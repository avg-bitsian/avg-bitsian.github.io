description: The aim of Team BITS is to design a car that can fully run on ethanol. As a member of Team BITS, I re-engineered a motorcycle SI engine to an SPCCI engine for a car that can run on ethanol. I also designed an aerodynamic, lightweight, and durable chassis for the Shell Eco Asia competition.
